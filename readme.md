# Weather Info Web App üå¶Ô∏è

This is a simple weather app I made using JavaScript. It shows the current temperature of any place you search for. I used the WeatherAPI to get the live data.

## What It Does
- Takes the place name from the user.
- Fetches weather data from the API.
- Shows the temperature on the screen.
- If anything goes wrong, it shows an error in the browser console.

## What I Learned
- How to use the `fetch` function in JavaScript.
- How to work with APIs.
- How to show API data on a webpage using DOM methods.
- Handling `.then()` and `.catch()` for promises.

## Tools/Tech Used
- HTML for the basic structure.
- JavaScript to handle logic and API.
- WeatherAPI for data (I used my own API key).

## Notes
- It only shows temperature in Celsius.
- Internet is required for fetching live data.
- If the location is incorrect, it won't show anything and you need to check console for errors.

## Future Ideas
- Add more weather details like humidity and condition.
- Improve the UI using CSS.
- Maybe add a loading spinner.

This project helped me practice real-time API usage and JavaScript DOM updates. Just a beginner project but useful for learning!
